h1. Follow that Bird

h2. An implementation for Tweak-the-Tweet style emergency-response syntaxes.

The goal of this project is to search Twitter for tweets matching admin-definable syntaxes, extract defined structure from those tweets, and publish/share that structure as quickly as possible.

The goal is for this project to be a central repository for formatted tweets.  We need to bear in mind extensibility and ease of building plug-in modules in the design and development of this app.

h2. Basic stuff

*Currently:*
* The model layer is somewhat developed.
* Polling twitter search for tweets matching hashtags (script/runner Tweet.poll_indefinitely) exists.

*Not yet:*
* Views for adding syntaxes.
* Extracting hashtags from syntaxes on a Syntax lifecycle callback (before_save, likely).  The tricky bit here will be removing hashtags before or after destroy but only if they aren't used by any other syntaxes.
* Associate tweets that match (Syntax#match) a syntax with the matching syntax.
* Extract the hash data returned by Syntax#match(tweet.text) and associate it with both the tweet and the syntax.
